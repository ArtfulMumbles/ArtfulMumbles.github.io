I designed and built this **quadrupedal robot** from the ground up, starting with ideation and progressing through **Fusion 360 design** and **3D printing**. The robot was fully simulated using **Isaac Sim** and incorporates **LiDAR** and an **IMU sensor** for sensing and stabilization. I also experimented with **Isaac Gym** to explore enhanced control through simulation.

The robot features:
- **IMU for stability**  
- **LiDAR for environmental mapping**  
- **Simulation in Isaac Sim and Isaac Gym**

Below are two videos that demonstrate the robot in action:

</div>

This project was an incredible opportunity to combine **mechanical design, sensing integration, and simulation tools**. It also allowed me to learn and explore the **potential of autonomous robotics through trial and error**.
