I designed and built this quadrupedal robot entirely from scratch, starting from ideation to the final product. Using **Fusion 360**, I modeled the design and proceeded to **3D print** the components. The robot was fully simulated in **Isaac Sim** and features both **LiDAR** and an **IMU sensor** for enhanced sensing capabilities. I also explored the potential of **Isaac Gym** for improved sensing and control.

The robot integrates **sensors like an IMU** to stabilize its movement and **LiDAR** for environmental mapping. Below is a video demonstrating the robot's capabilities:

This project pushed the limits of my knowledge in **mechanical design, sensor integration, and simulation tools**, culminating in a functional and modular robot.
