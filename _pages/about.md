I'm a third-year student at Duke University pursuing degrees in ECE and CS. My work blends AI, robotics, and bioinformatics, where I explore applications of machine learning in both physical systems and biological research. I'm currently researching protein language models for use in drug development under the guidance of Dr. Rohit Singh.

My work has earned me a Pratt Fellowship and consideration for graduation with distinction in ECE. I also serve as a TA for undergraduate ECE labs.

I enjoy photography, italian fusion cuisine, and host a podcast that highlights Duke's most impressive talent.
