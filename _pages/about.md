I'm a third-year student at <a href="https://duke.edu" target="_blank">Duke University</a> pursuing degrees in ECE and CS. My work blends AI, robotics, and bioinformatics, where I explore applications of <a href="https://labwebsite.com" target="_blank">protein language models</a> for drug development under the guidance of <a href="https://rohitsinghlab.com" target="_blank">Dr. Rohit Singh</a>.

My work has earned me a <a href="https://pratt.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Pratt Fellowship</a> and consideration for graduation with distinction in ECE. I also serve as a TA for undergraduate ECE labs.

I enjoy <a href="/portfolio">photography</a>, Italian fusion cuisine, and <a href="https://spotify.com/your-podcast" target="_blank">host a podcast</a> that highlights Duke's most impressive talent.
