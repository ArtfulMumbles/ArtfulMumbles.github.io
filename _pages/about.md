I’m Michael Scutari, a junior at Duke University pursuing a dual degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science (CS). My work blends AI, robotics, and bioinformatics, where I explore applications of machine learning in both physical systems and biological research. Currently, I’m involved in cutting-edge bioinformatics research under the guidance of Dr. Rohit Singh, focusing on leveraging AI to solve complex biological challenges.

In addition to research, I am a Pratt Fellow and a TA, where I mentor students and develop meaningful academic relationships. My passions extend to sustainability and the intersection of technology with environmental impact, as I aspire to make meaningful contributions without compromising my investment in these causes.

Beyond academics, I enjoy experimenting with Italian cuisine, refining my photography skills, and playing strategy games like Team Fight Tactics. I value meaningful connections and am actively developing my career toward graduate research or consulting, seeking ways to balance technical work with real-world impact.

Let’s connect over robotics, AI, or even your favorite Italian recipe!
